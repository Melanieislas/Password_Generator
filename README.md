# Password_Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to demonstrate and practice the skills I learned in class to build a interactive webpage through javascript
- This project helps the user generate a strong password with chosen criteria
- From this project, I learned how to incorporate for and while loops to generate the strong password with criteria chosen by the user

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
