# Password_Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to demonstrate and practice the skills I learned in class to build a interactive webpage through javascript
- This project helps the user generate a strong password with chosen criteria
- From this project, I learned how to incorporate for and while loops to generate the strong password with criteria chosen by the user
